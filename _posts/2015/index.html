Requirements engineering (RE) in agile and open source settings is quite different than RE in more conventional development settings. In particular, these requirements tend to be more ad-hoc and ‘just-in-time’, developed as needed rather than upfront. Requirements might be called user stories, features, or even tasks [1].

Just in time as a production strategy can be traced to Toyota and other Japanese firms in the 1950s. The strategy referred to meeting customer demand at the right time and in the exact amount, where customer could be the final purchaser or another process further along the production line. Ohno [2] underpinned just in time with 3 principles of economic growth: build only what is needed, eliminate anything which does not add value, and stop if something goes wrong.

The just-in-time philosophy was also applied to software engineering, serving as a basic tenet of the lean software practices and the agile community [3]. Research on just-in-time requirements has recently emerged [4-6], which not only challenges classical RE’s assumptions [7] but also illuminates potentially transformative ideas to improve RE practice especially in distributed and decentralized settings [8].

<h2>Format</h2>
This 1-day workshop will consist of an opening keynote, followed by morning presentations. Post-lunch, we will have one more paper session and then breakout sessions in order to develop a ranked list of open problems. The final session will group back all workshop participants to summarize their discussion results, collect feedback, and plan future events and activities.
<h2>Anticipated Outcomes</h2>
This initial workshop on just-in-time RE aims to gather researchers working in this area in order to discover a set of open research problems and define a position statement outlining the ways in which just-in-time RE differs from traditional RE. Some characteristics like lightweight representation and evolutionary refinement of requirements are identified in [4, 5]. However, we anticipate wide, varied, open, and lively discussions reshaping the landscape and themes of just-in-time RE in the workshop. It is also our anticipation that the workshop provides a venue for researchers and practitioners to share their experiences, forge new collaborations, and provoke innovative ways to tackle just-in-time requirements.
