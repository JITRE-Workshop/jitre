Requirements engineering (RE) in agile and open source settings is quite different than RE in more conventional development settings. In particular, these requirements tend to be more ad-hoc and ‘just-in-time’, developed as needed rather than upfront. Requirements might be called user stories, features, or even tasks. The differences become even more evident when it comes to optimal management of software quality demands and the integration of non-functional requirements into the software life cycle.

This year, the Just-in-Time requirements engineering workshop will therefore put a particular focus on current challenges that agile software development teams face when integrating non-functional requirements into their practices. For instance, how are they represented in the backlog (as user stories, as acceptance criteria, ...)? How are they integrated into testing strategies? The theme is accordingly “Dealing with Non-functional requirements in Agile Software Development”. The workshop aims to gather researchers and practitioners in order to share their experiences, forge new collaborations, and provoke innovative ways to tackle just-in-time requirements.

## Key Dates

- Paper Submission	~~Friday, June 09, 2017~~ Friday June 16, 2017 (AoE)
- Paper Notification	Friday, June 30, 2017
- Camera Ready Due	Sunday, July 16, 2017
- Workshop Tuesday, September 5, 2017

## Format

This 1-day workshop will consist of an opening keynote, followed by morning presentations. Post-lunch, we will have one more paper session and then breakout sessions in order to develop a ranked list of open problems. The final session will group back all workshop participants to summarize their discussion results, collect feedback, and plan future events and activities.

## Anticipated Outcomes

This initial workshop on just-in-time RE aims to gather researchers working in this area in order to discover a set of open research problems and define a position statement outlining the ways in which just-in-time RE differs from traditional RE. Some characteristics like lightweight representation and evolutionary refinement of requirements are identified in <sup>[1](#ref1)</sup>, <sup>[2](#ref2)</sup>. However, we anticipate wide, varied, open, and lively discussions reshaping the landscape and themes of just-in-time RE in the workshop. It is also our anticipation that the workshop provides a venue for researchers and practitioners to share their experiences, forge new collaborations, and provoke innovative ways to tackle just-in-time requirements.
